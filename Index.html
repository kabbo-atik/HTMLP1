    <br> 
    I love to play <strong>Video Game</strong>. As like <em><b>PUBG, Free Fire, COC, Candy Crush Saga</b></em> etc. But I can't play games due to lack of time, so I Only play <strong>COC</strong> game sometimes. Even <em><b>3-4 years</b></em> back i used to spend hours <strong>Playing Games</strong>. If I didn't play cricket or football when I was a child, I couldn't sleep at night. As I grow older, I dislike sports on the field. However, I still play <b>badminton</b> sometimes. That too in winter.</p>
